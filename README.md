# Lazer_Backend

With certain features like simple or login,singup or with Google, plus different routes for retrieve data, a small backend project for a Lazer app was built with node.js.

## to start

`nodemon app`

`node app`


## Caution

Login is implemented with JWT but session is stored over local Storage and not on cookies.

Login with google will not work because it is meant to be for one user only as it is not a paid service so in order to add that feature you need create or add your own google cloud account and attached this server to it.
